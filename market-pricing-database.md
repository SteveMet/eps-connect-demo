## HOW TO USE THIS DATABASE

This database is the **competitive intelligence source** for the print-estimator agent.
When generating a quote, compare AccuPrint's pricing against:

1. **Low end** — Are we above the cheapest online option? (Expected: yes, usually)
2. **Average** — Are we within 10–15% of market average? (Target: yes)
3. **High end** — Are we below premium pricing? (Target: always)

### AccuPrint's Value Proposition vs. Online Printers
- Personal service and consultation (online printers are self-service)
- Local delivery and hands-on account management
- Custom solutions (gang runs, specialty finishing, kitting)
- Quality control with human press checks available
- Flexibility on specs and last-minute changes
- One-stop shop (print + mail + fulfillment + design)
- No surprise shipping charges
- Rush capability with direct plant access

These value-adds justify pricing **at or slightly above market average** — but we should
never be dramatically above the high end without a clear reason (rush, specialty, etc.).
